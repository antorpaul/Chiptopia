# Chiptopia
Co-Op Multiplayer game inspired by Chipotle's great Mexican food

When Captain Chipotle is shipwrecked, he ended up near Antarctica. When he finally wakes up, heâ€™s discovered that the penguins have helped revive him. In order to thank them, he tells them about his best burrito. He made it knowing that there was no way to save the ship, but left a map to it in the magical land of Chiptopia. He gives the penguins this map and they try to find it. The rest of the game is a quest to find this legendary burrito.

The game relies heavily on teamwork to make it through puzzle-like levels. When one penguin cannot jump high enough, the other must be a stepstool and wait for the teammate to carry on challenges.

Chiptopia was originally intended for the phone as a multiplayer co-op game like Spaceteam. Two players would be connected through wifi and have the abiity to play by tilting their phone for movement and tapping to jump. By utilizing tilts instead of having on screen controls, players will be able to play on their phone in either portrait or landscape mode.

However... we didn't know anything about developing that. For me, it was my first hackathon. On top of that, Ben, Stella and I are primarily front-end developers. We love designing and thinking of concepts. But a hackathon is about learning right?

By Saturday, we decided we would learn C# and Unity well enough to have a playable game with proper physics (thanks to Ben's sacrifice of sleep). We became addicted to this game and we hope you will too!

UPDATE: The game was very far from polished. We had a blast making it and all the ups and downs that came with learning a new language were extremely dramatic in our 24 hour period. We are definitely planning to pursue what we conceived in art and design when our knowledge of C# and Unity catch up.
